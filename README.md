## Development

Contributions are welcome!

This repository uses `yarn` to organize the code. As such, after cloning dependencies should be installed via yarn, not via npm.
[Vue js](https://vuejs.org/) framework is used to create user interfaces.


To start -

1. Clone the repo locally, via `git clone https://github.com/airalab/dapp.robonomics.network <optional local path>`
2. Ensure that you have a recent LTS version of Node.js, for development purposes Node >= 16 is recommended.
3. Ensure that you have a recent version of Yarn, for development purposes Yarn >= 1.22 is required.
4. Install the dependencies by running
```
yarn
```
5. Ready! Now you can launch the UI (assuming you have a local Polkadot Node running), via
```
yarn serve
```
6. Access the UI via http://localhost:8080
